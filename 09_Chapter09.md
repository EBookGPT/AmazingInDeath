# Code Explanation

In this chapter of Amazing In Death, we explored various methods of poisoning to understand the crimes from the perspective of forensic science. Let us dive into the code used by the investigative team.

```python
def poison_analysis(victim, substance):
    # Analyze victim's symptoms and determine potential poison
    symptoms = analyze_symptoms(victim)
    poison_type = classify_poison(substance)
    
    if poison_type == "toxic":
        # Begin antidote treatment
        administer_antidote(victim)
    else:
        # Investigate further for potential homicide
        investigate_scene(victim)
```
The above function takes in the victim's name and the substance that they may have ingested. It begins by analyzing the victim's symptoms and determining the potential poison. The function then classifies the poison as either toxic or non-toxic. If the substance is toxic, the victim needs to be treated with an antidote immediately. However, if the substance is non-toxic, further investigation is required to determine if there was an intention to poison the victim.

```python
def analyze_symptoms(victim):
    # Analyze victim's physiological and physical symptoms
    symptoms = []
    for symptom in victim.symptoms:
        if symptom in toxic_poison_list:
            symptoms.append(symptom)
    return symptoms
```
The above function is used to analyze the victim's physiological and physical symptoms. It loops through the symptoms listed by the victim and checks if they match with those of a toxic poison. If a symptom is found, it is added to a list.

```python
def classify_poison(substance):
    # Classify the substance as either toxic or non-toxic
    if substance in toxic_substances_list:
        return "toxic"
    else:
        return "non-toxic"
```
The above function takes in the name of the substance and classifies it as either toxic or non-toxic. It does this by checking whether the substance is listed as a toxic substance.

```python
def administer_antidote(victim):
    # Administer antidote to victim
    victim.antidote = get_antidote(victim.poison_type)
    victim.is_treated = True
```
The above function is used to administer the antidote to the victim if the substance is classified as toxic. It obtains the appropriate antidote for the type of poison the victim has ingested and sets the `is_treated` property of the victim object to true.

```python
def investigate_scene(victim):
    # Begin investigation into potential homicide
    suspects = get_suspects(victim)
    for suspect in suspects:
        analyze_suspect(suspect)
```
The above function is used to investigate the scene further if the substance is classified as non-toxic. It obtains a list of suspects who were present when the victim ingested the substance and loops through each suspect to analyze their behavior and alibis.

These functions are a simplified representation of the complex work done by forensic teams in investigating poison-related crimes.
