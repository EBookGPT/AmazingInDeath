# Chapter 8: Deadly Animals: From Microscopic Creatures to Massive Beasts

Welcome back, dear readers! We hope you have safely recovered from the adrenaline rush of our last chapter, The Most Dangerous Places in the World. Today, we will delve into the world of deadly animals, both large and small. 

As you know, New York City in the year 2060 has its fair share of beastly creatures. We don't just mean the humans. From lions and tigers to microscopic organisms, nature has its way of keeping us on our toes. Even the most advanced technology cannot protect us from every venomous bite, sting or wound caused by a wild animal. 

As always, Lieutenant Eve Dallas is at the forefront of revealing the dangers posed by these deadly creatures. Join her as she puts her keen detective skills and scientific knowledge to the test. Just as we think we know everything there is to know about the animal kingdom, Eve is always ready to prove us wrong.

So, grab your microscope, binoculars, and hazmat suit and come with us as we explore the untamed wilderness lurking within the cracks of our own city. We hope you're ready, dear readers, for a wild ride!
# Amazing In Death: Chapter 8 Exercise 

Welcome to the exercise section of our Deadly Animals chapter. 

In this exercise, we will be diving into the world of Python and using it to analyze data on deadly animals. As always, we will be following in the footsteps of Lieutenant Eve Dallas as we put our detective skills to the test. 

For this exercise, we will be using the `pandas` and `matplotlib` libraries in Python to analyze and visualize data on deadly animal attacks. You will need to have these libraries installed in your system prior to the exercise, as well as a dataset on animal attacks. If you don't have one, a quick google search will give you plenty of options to choose from. 

Once you have your dataset and libraries ready, we will dive into the following tasks:
1. Load the data into a pandas dataframe and take a quick look at its structure.
2. Clean the data by handling missing values and transforming the data into a format useful for our analysis.
3. Conduct some exploratory data analysis, including visualizing the distribution of animal attacks by type, location and time.
4. Identify any trends or patterns in the data and draw conclusions from it.

As always, feel free to personalize your approach or add additional tasks to this exercise. We look forward to seeing how you follow in the footsteps of Lieutenant Eve Dallas and uncover the mysteries of deadly animals through code.
# Analysis of Deadly Animal attacks

In this exercise, we explored the `pandas` and `matplotlib` libraries in Python to analyze and visualize data on deadly animal attacks. 

### Loading the data
We started by loading the data into a pandas dataframe using the `read_csv()` function. This allowed us to quickly inspect the data and its structure using pandas' built-in functions like `head()`, `info()`, and `describe()`. This gave us a brief view of the data and its characteristics.

### Data Cleaning
Next, we cleaned the data by handling missing values and transforming the data into a format useful for our analysis. We used the `fillna()` function to fill missing values with the median of the column, and the `map()` method to clean up some inconsistent data entries. In addition, we transformed the date column into a datetime object, which allowed us to manipulate the data with `pandas` time series functions.

### Data Exploration
Once we had clean data, we conducted some exploratory data analysis (EDA) by visualizing the distribution of animal attacks by type, location, and time. We used `matplotlib` for our data visualization, creating a histogram plot to show the distribution of attacks by each animal type. We also created a stacked bar chart to show the distribution of attacks by location and time.

### Drawing Conclusions
Finally, we identified trends and patterns in the data using our EDA results. We found that of the different animal types, venomous snakes and domestic dogs were responsible for the highest number of deadly attacks. In addition, we found that the majority of attacks occurred in North America and Africa. Finally, we found that the number of animal attacks has been decreasing over time, particularly since the 1990s. 

By conducting this analysis, we can better understand the risks posed by deadly animals and take the necessary precautions to stay safe. Like Lieutenant Eve Dallas, we can use data and science to unlock the mysteries of the animal kingdom.
