# Chapter 12: Death in the Digital Age: Legacy and Remembrance in The Online World

As we continue to explore the afterlife in the Amazing In Death series, we can't help but take a closer look at death in the digital age. With the rise of technology and social media, our lives have become increasingly intertwined with the online world. But what happens to our digital presence when we pass away? Can we leave a lasting legacy in the virtual realm?

To help us answer these questions, we invited special guest Sherry Turkle to join us for this chapter. Sherry is a leading expert on the impact of technology on society and the author of "Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other." Her insights were invaluable as we explored the issues surrounding death and legacy in the digital age.

In this chapter, we examine how social media platforms and other online services handle the accounts of deceased users, the importance of digital estate planning, and the ways in which our online presence can serve as a form of remembrance. We also dive into the legal and ethical implications of posthumous digital interactions and the changing nature of mourning in the digital age.

So grab your tablet or smartphone and join us as we explore the fascinating intersection of death and technology with special guest Sherry Turkle.

In this chapter, we don't dive into code specifically. However, we do acknowledge the importance of digital estate planning, which can include considerations for your online accounts and digital assets.

Digital estate planning involves creating a plan for how your digital assets will be managed in the event of your death or incapacitation. This can include passwords to social media accounts or online banking services, as well as instructions for how you would like your accounts to be handled. 

While there is no specific code used to resolve the issues discussed in this chapter, it's important for individuals to consider their digital legacies and plan accordingly to ensure their wishes are carried out and their digital assets are managed appropriately after they pass away.
